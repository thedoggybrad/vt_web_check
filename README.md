# What is this project and how it works?
This is the VirusTotal Website Security Check, it is created by TheDoggyBrad Software Lab. It allows you to check the security of a website by typing in the full URL of the website (on the website) or by clicking the extension (on web browser extensions). Then it automatically opens the VirusTotal security page that shows the result of various AV-provider's hypothesis on that website., similar to the behavior of a VirusTotal API. But... this site or extension does not use an API key. Instead it is a reverse-engineering of the URL search function of the VirusTotal website. You may look at its code at https://github.com/thedoggybrad/vt_web_check

## Website Version

## Edge Extension

## Opera Extension
Update: Opera is currently reviewing the extension.

## Chromium Extension (Help needed)
I am not a rich developer. I just develop using free solutions and the Chrome WebStore developer account is not free. I need help for someone to publish my extension on the Chrome Web Store on my behalf.
<br>
Link for the extension (Unpacked): https://github.com/thedoggybrad/vt_web_check/tree/main/Chromium%20(Manifest%20v3)
<br>
Once you have published the extension, post the published link here https://github.com/thedoggybrad/vt_web_check/issues for me to update this section with the published link.<br><br>
But... you may install it the hard way atleast for now. Visit https://github.com/thedoggybrad/vt_web_check/releases/tag/tempchrome1.0 to know more!

### Roadmap
✓A website<br>
✓Firefox-family Extension<br>
