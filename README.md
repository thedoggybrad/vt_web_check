# What is this project and how it works?
This is the VirusTotal Website Security Check, it is created by TheDoggyBrad Software Lab. It allows you to check the security of a website by typing in the full URL of the website or by clicking the extension (upcoming). Then it automatically opens the VirusTotal security page that shows the result of various AV-provider's hypothesis on that website., similar to the behavior of a VirusTotal API. But... this site does not use an API key. Instead it is a reverse-engineering of the URL search function of the VirusTotal website. You may look at its code at https://github.com/thedoggybrad/vt_web_check
