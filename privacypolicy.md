# Privacy Policy for VirusTotal Website Security Check (Web browser extension)

Effective Date: December 18, 2024

This Privacy Policy outlines how VirusTotal Website Security Check ("we," "our," or "the extension") collects, uses, and protects your data. By using our extension, you consent to the practices described in this policy. Please read it carefully.

1. Data Collection
Our extension only collects and sends data to VirusTotal when the user initiates the action by clicking the extension button. We do not collect or transmit any data without your explicit consent.

The data sent to VirusTotal is determined by your action and is solely limited to the specific request you make, which is URL analysis. The data will only be sent to VirusTotal when you click the extension and confirm your action in the confirmation prompt.

2. Data Transmission to VirusTotal
When you click the extension, a confirmation prompt will appear, asking if you would like to send the data to VirusTotal. This prompt ensures that you have full control over whether the data is transmitted. If you confirm, the extension sends the necessary information to VirusTotal for security analysis purposes.

The data is transmitted through a URL not by using an API.

3. User Consent
Each time you click the extension, you will be prompted to confirm whether you want to send data to VirusTotal. This ensures that data is only sent with your explicit consent. If you choose not to confirm, the data will not be transmitted.

4. No Personal Data Collection
We do not collect any personal information, such as your name, email address, or browsing history, when using the extension. The data that is sent to VirusTotal is solely related to security analysis of files or URLs you choose to submit.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will post the updated policy here, along with the effective date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your data.
